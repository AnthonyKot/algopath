    "problem_statement": "A bead slides frictionlessly down a wire from point $A$ to point $B$ (which is lower but not directly below $A$). Gravity pulls the bead downward.\n\n**What shape of wire** minimizes the travel time from $A$ to $B$?\n\n**Historical Context:** Johann Bernoulli posed this challenge in 1696 to the greatest mathematicians of Europe. Newton, Leibniz, and others all solved it — launching the field of **Calculus of Variations**.",
    "explanation": {
      "understanding_the_problem": "This is the founding problem of **Calculus of Variations** — the math of optimizing not just numbers, but entire *functions* (curves).\n\nIntuition might suggest:\n- **Straight line?** Shortest distance, but the bead starts slowly (low speed at top).\n- **Steep drop first?** Gains speed early, but path becomes longer.\n\nThe optimal curve balances these tradeoffs. The answer is neither a line nor a parabola — it's a **Cycloid**!",
      "brute_force": "**Setting Up the Time Integral**\n\nUsing energy conservation, the speed at height $y$ below the start is:\n$$v = \\sqrt{2gy}$$\n\nThe time to traverse a small arc length $ds$ is:\n$$dt = \\frac{ds}{v} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1 + (dy/dx)^2}}{\\sqrt{2gy}}dx$$\n\nTotal time:\n$$T = \\int_0^{x_B} \\frac{\\sqrt{1 + y'^2}}{\\sqrt{2gy}} dx$$\n\nWe need to find the function $y(x)$ that minimizes this integral.",
      "bottleneck": "This is not ordinary calculus — we're minimizing over all possible *curves*, not just finding the minimum of a function of one variable.",
      "optimized_approach": "**The Euler-Lagrange Equation**\n\nFor functionals of the form $\\int F(y, y', x) dx$, the minimizing curve satisfies:\n$$\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} - \\frac{d}{dx}\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y'} = 0$$\n\nSince our $F$ doesn't depend on $x$ explicitly, there's a shortcut (Beltrami identity):\n$$F - y'\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y'} = C$$\n\n**Solving the ODE**\n\nAfter substitution and simplification, this leads to:\n$$y(1 + y'^2) = 2R$$\n\nfor some constant $R$. This is the differential equation of a **Cycloid**!\n\n**Parametric Solution:**\n$$x = R(\\theta - \\sin\\theta), \\quad y = R(1 - \\cos\\theta)$$",
      "algorithm_steps": "1. Write time as functional: $T[y] = \\int \\frac{\\sqrt{1+y'^2}}{\\sqrt{2gy}} dx$\n2. Identify the Lagrangian $F(y, y')$\n3. Apply Beltrami identity (since $F$ is independent of $x$)\n4. Solve the resulting ODE: $y(1 + y'^2) = const$\n5. Recognize solution as parametric cycloid equations",
      "result_analysis": "**Final Answer — The Cycloid:**\n\n$$x(\\theta) = R(\\theta - \\sin\\theta)$$\n$$y(\\theta) = R(1 - \\cos\\theta)$$\n\nwhere $R$ is chosen so the curve passes through point $B$.\n\n**What is a Cycloid?**\n\nIt's the curve traced by a point on the rim of a rolling wheel! Imagine a circle rolling along a ceiling — the path of a point on its edge is exactly the brachistochrone.\n\n**Why is it Faster Than a Straight Line?**\n\nThe cycloid **drops steeply at first**, gaining speed quickly while the path is still short. The 'extra' distance is compensated by higher velocity.\n\n**The Tautochrone Property:**\n\nRemarkably, the cycloid is also **isochronous** — a ball released from *any* point on a cycloid takes the **same time** to reach the bottom! This was used in Huygens' pendulum clocks.\n\n**Applications:**\n\n- **Lagrangian Mechanics**: This problem birthed the principle of 'Least Action'\n- **Roller Coaster Design**: Optimizing thrill vs. safety\n- **Optics**: Fermat's principle (light takes the fastest path) uses the same math\n- **Machine Learning**: Gradient descent is a discrete version of this optimization"
